# Code Camp 2017 - Machine Learning

## Virtual Machine

To start the virtual machine:
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
1. Run ```vagrant up``` in the repository root directory (ie. the one containing ```Vagrantfile```)
1. Use ```vagrant ssh``` in the root directory to ```ssh``` into the machine
1. To stop the virtual machine without ```ssh```, either suspend it with ```vagrant suspend``` or stop it with ```vagrant halt```
