# Code Camp 2017 - Machine Learning

## Virtual Machine

### Getting started

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
1. Run ```vagrant up``` in the repository root directory (ie. the one containing ```Vagrantfile```)
1. Use ```vagrant ssh``` in the root directory to ```ssh``` into the machine
1. To stop the virtual machine without ```ssh```, either suspend it with ```vagrant suspend``` or stop it with ```vagrant halt```


### Varia

* The password for an interactive login is ```ubuntu``` (with the user ```ubuntu```)
* The repository root directory is mounted in the virtual machine as ```/vagrant```
